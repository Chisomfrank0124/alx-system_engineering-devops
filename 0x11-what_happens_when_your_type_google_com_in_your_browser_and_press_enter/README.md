WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TYPE GOOGLE.COMIN YOUR BROWSER AND PRESS ENTER
When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a series of complex processes take place behind the scenes, which enable you to access the Google homepage. In this blog post, we will explain the step-by-step process of how your request is processed and how you are redirected to the Google homepage.

DNS request
The first step in the process is the DNS (Domain Name System) request. When you enter a URL in your browser, it sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address that the browser can understand. The DNS server responds with the IP address of the server where the website is hosted.

TCP/IP
After the DNS request is processed, your browser establishes a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) connection with the server. The TCP/IP protocol ensures that your data is transmitted safely and reliably across the internet.

Firewall
Once the TCP/IP connection is established, your request goes through the firewall. The firewall is a security measure that checks whether the request is legitimate or not. If the request is legitimate, it is forwarded to the next step. Otherwise, it is blocked.

HTTPS/SSL
If the request passes through the firewall, your browser negotiates an HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) connection with the server. HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data between the browser and the server. This ensures that the data cannot be intercepted by third parties.

Load-balancer
After the HTTPS connection is established, your request is sent to a load-balancer. A load-balancer is a server that distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure optimal performance. The load-balancer checks the availability of the servers and directs your request to the server with the least load.

Web server
Once the load-balancer has determined the appropriate server, your request is forwarded to the web server. The web server is responsible for handling the request and returning a response. In this case, the web server returns the Google homepage as the response.

Application server
In some cases, the web server may not be able to generate the response directly. Instead, it may need to communicate with an application server to generate the response. An application server is a server that hosts applications that provide dynamic content to web pages. The application server generates the response based on the user's request and sends it back to the web server.

Database
Finally, the web server may need to retrieve data from a database to generate the response. A database is a server that stores structured data. In this case, the web server may need to retrieve information such as search results or user data from a database before generating the response.

In conclusion, typing "https://www.google.com" in your browser and pressing Enter initiates a complex process that involves multiple servers and protocols. The process ensures that your request is processed quickly and securely, and you receive the Google homepage as the response. Understanding this process can help you appreciate the technical complexity that goes into providing reliable and secure web services.

how to submit a pull request and generate its link

ChatGPT
To submit a pull request on GitHub, you can follow these steps:

Fork the repository: Navigate to the repository that you want to contribute to and click on the "Fork" button on the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your account.

Clone the forked repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the git clone command in the terminal. For example:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
Create a branch: Create a new branch to make your changes. Use a descriptive name for the branch that indicates what you are working on. For example:

css
Copy code
git checkout -b fix-bug
Make changes: Make the necessary changes to the codebase.

Commit changes: Once you have made the changes, commit them to the branch using the git commit command. For example:

sql
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Fix bug in feature X"
Push changes: Push the changes to your forked repository using the git push command. For example:

perl
Copy code
git push origin fix-bug
Create a pull request: Go to the original repository that you forked from and click on the "New pull request" button. Select the branch that you just pushed your changes to, and then fill out the pull request form with the relevant information. Once you are satisfied with your pull request, click on the "Create pull request" button.

Copy the pull request link: After you have created the pull request, you can copy the link by clicking on the "Copy link" button on the pull request page.

The pull request link will look something like this: https://github.com/original-repository/compare/master...your-username:fix-bug. This link can be shared with others to review and comment on your changes.
